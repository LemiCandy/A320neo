# A320neo
**IMPORTANT INFO: A319 is temporary removed due to huge problems with flight dynamics**

This is a repository of Airbus -321 and -319 neo aircrafts based on the Artix75's version for FlightGear. Include some bugfixes, changed models, more liveries and sounds

Much thanks to SXSA and Sokół for helping me with liveries
